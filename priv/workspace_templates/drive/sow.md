# Statement of Work Template

Welcome to the baseline project SOW folder. Use this structure when generating new statements:

## Outline
1. **Overview** – context, goals, stakeholders.
2. **Scope** – deliverables, non-goals, success measures.
3. **Timeline** – phases, milestones, checkpoints.
4. **Resourcing** – primary team, escalation paths, vendor dependencies.
5. **Commercials** – pricing model, payment schedule, assumptions.

## Tips
- Track revision history with `REV-YYYYMMDD` suffixes.
- Pair each SOW with a change-order doc for lightweight amendments.
- Flag client-visible TODOs with `@@CLIENT_ACTION@@` so PMs can sweep before sharing.
