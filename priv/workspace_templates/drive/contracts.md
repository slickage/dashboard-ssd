# Contracts Workspace

## Purpose
- Centralize executed contracts, MSAs, and SOW addenda for the project.
- Provide client-friendly descriptions plus internal owner notes.

## Recommended Sections
1. **Summary** – elevate the agreement title, effective date, and renewal window.
2. **Signature Package** – link to primary PDF + native Google Doc if editing is planned.
3. **Change Tracking** – list open change orders, redlines, or addenda in progress.

## Operational Notes
- Store scanned signatures in `/Signatures` with YYYY-MM-DD prefixes.
- Keep a copy of the countersigned contract in `/Archive` once superseded.
- Toggle `Client can edit` sparingly; default to read-only for compliance.
