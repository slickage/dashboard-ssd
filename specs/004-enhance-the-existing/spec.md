# Feature Specification: Knowledge Base Explorer Enhancements

**Feature Branch**: `004-enhance-the-existing`  
**Created**: 2025-10-13  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Enhance the existing “Knowledge Base Explorer” view inside DashboardSSD so internal teammates can more easily browse and read company documentation synced from Notion."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Browse Collections Quickly (Priority: P1)

Internal teammates need to open the Knowledge Base Explorer and immediately understand which collections exist and what has changed recently so they can decide where to dive in.

**Why this priority**: Without a clear landing experience the explorer remains confusing, preventing adoption and any downstream improvements from delivering value.

**Independent Test**: QA loads the explorer as a first-time user and verifies collections, counts, freshness indicators, and the recently opened list render without interacting with other features.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an authenticated teammate with access to multiple collections, **When** they load the explorer, **Then** the page lists each collection with name, description (if available), document count, and last updated indicator.
2. **Given** a teammate who previously opened documents, **When** they return to the explorer landing view, **Then** a “Recently opened” list shows the most recent items with timestamps ordered from newest to oldest.
3. **Given** no collections are returned by the Notion service, **When** the user loads the explorer, **Then** an empty state explains that nothing is available yet and suggests checking back later or contacting the workspace admin.

### User Story 2 - Drill Into a Collection (Priority: P2)

Internal teammates want to open a collection and skim its documents using consistent metadata so they can pick the right article without extra clicks.

**Why this priority**: Browsing within a collection is the core path to knowledge discovery; without it the explorer cannot help teams stay aligned.

**Independent Test**: QA navigates from landing into one collection and verifies list rendering, sorting, and empty-state behavior without invoking search or the reader pane.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a collection with multiple documents, **When** the teammate opens it, **Then** the explorer shows a list view with title, short description or preview text, tag chips, owner, and last updated timestamp for each document.
2. **Given** a collection with no documents, **When** the teammate opens it, **Then** an empty-state message clarifies the absence of content and offers a link back to collections.
3. **Given** the Notion service fails to return document metadata, **When** the teammate opens the collection, **Then** the explorer surfaces a non-blocking error banner with retry guidance.

### User Story 3 - Find and Read the Right Document (Priority: P3)

Teammates need to search across the knowledge base, open a document, and read it comfortably with trustworthy metadata so they can act on the information.

**Why this priority**: Effective search and reading ensure the explorer resolves real questions; without it the improvements fail to reduce support pings or duplicated work.

**Independent Test**: QA enters search terms, selects a result, and validates rendering of all supported block types and metadata without touching collection browsing.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the teammate types at least three characters in the search bar, **When** the query matches titles or tags, **Then** the document list updates in real time to show relevant results grouped or clearly labeled by collection and ordered by recency.
2. **Given** a teammate selects a document from results or a collection list, **When** the reader pane loads, **Then** the document displays text, headings, callouts, images, code blocks, and internal Notion links with consistent formatting and spacing.
3. **Given** the teammate is viewing a document, **When** they open the metadata section, **Then** they see owner, last updated timestamp, and a copyable share link that points to the same document in Notion.

### Edge Cases

- No collections or documents returned for a user with valid access.
- Recently opened list includes references to documents that were deleted or permissions revoked.
- Notion API returns degraded content (e.g., missing blocks, unsupported block types).
- Document metadata lacks owner or last updated information.
- Search terms produce no results or include special characters/emojis.
- Network error occurs while loading search results or rendering a document mid-session.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The explorer MUST display a collection card for each collection returned by the Notion service, including title, short description (when provided), document count, and last updated indicator.
- **FR-002**: The explorer MUST surface a “Recently opened” list on the landing view containing the most recent documents accessed by the current user (minimum of five items when available) with timestamps.
- **FR-003**: Selecting a collection MUST navigate to a list view showing all documents within that collection ordered by most recently updated first.
- **FR-004**: Each document row in the collection view MUST show title, short description or excerpt, primary tag(s), owner name, and last updated timestamp.
- **FR-005**: The explorer MUST provide consistent empty-state messaging when a collection contains zero documents or metadata cannot be retrieved.
- **FR-006**: A search bar MUST be available that filters documents by title or tag across all collections as the user types, updating visible results within one second of input and labeling each result with its collection.
- **FR-007**: Search results MUST respect existing access controls, excluding documents the user lacks permission to view.
- **FR-008**: Opening a document MUST render text, headings, callouts, images, code blocks, tables, and internal Notion links using the established style guide without layout overlap or truncation.
- **FR-009**: The document reader MUST show owner, last updated timestamp, and a copyable share link referencing the Notion source.
- **FR-010**: The explorer MUST persist and reuse the user’s last selected collection or search query when they navigate back within the session.
- **FR-011**: When the Notion service fails or returns incomplete data, the explorer MUST present a clear error message with a retry action that does not disrupt unrelated sections.
- **FR-012**: All interactive elements MUST be reachable via keyboard navigation and expose descriptive labels for assistive technologies.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Collection**: Represents a curated grouping of documents; attributes include `collection_id`, title, description, document_count, last_updated_at, and optionally hero image; relates to multiple documents.
- **Document**: Represents a single Notion page; attributes include `document_id`, collection reference, title, summary excerpt, tags, owner(s), last_updated_at, share_url, and rendered content blocks.
- **RecentActivity**: Represents a pairing of user and document for recently opened tracking; attributes include `user_id`, `document_id`, last_viewed_at, and ordering index.

## Assumptions & Dependencies

- The existing Notion synchronization service continues to deliver collection, document metadata, and rendered block payloads without schema changes.
- DashboardSSD authentication and authorization remain responsible for determining which collections and documents an internal teammate may access.
- The DashboardSSD layout shell and design system components are available for re-use to maintain visual consistency and accessibility compliance.

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-13

- Q: Should knowledge base search operate globally across all collections or only within the currently selected collection? → A: Global search across all collections with collection labels

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: During usability testing, 90% of participants locate a needed document within three interactions (collection click or search query) using the enhanced explorer.
- **SC-002**: Document content renders within 1.5 seconds for 95% of documents tested that are under 5,000 words when accessed from the internal network.
- **SC-003**: QA validates that 100% of supported block types (text, headings, callouts, images, code blocks, tables, internal links) display without clipping or formatting regressions across the sample suite.
- **SC-004**: Internal feedback survey shows at least 80% of respondents agree that the updated explorer makes it easier to find up-to-date documentation compared with the prior experience.
