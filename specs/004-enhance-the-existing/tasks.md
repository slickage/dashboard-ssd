# Tasks: Knowledge Base Explorer Enhancements

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/004-enhance-the-existing/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Follow constitution-driven TDD‚Äîwrite or update tests within the implementation tasks before committing functionality.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Confirm environment configuration and tooling support required by all stories

- [X] T001 [P] [Setup] Validate Notion credentials and curated database ID configuration in `config/runtime.exs` and `.env.example`; document expected variables in `docs/notion.md`.
- [X] T002 [P] [Setup] Introduce curated collection allowlist source (e.g., `priv/notion/collections.json`) and loader wiring in `config/config.exs` with sample data.
- [X] T003 [P] [Setup] Ensure Notion client test stubbing via Mox is available by updating `test/support/notion_mox.ex` and registering it in `test/test_helper.exs`.

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [X] T004 [Foundational] Scaffold `lib/dashboard_ssd/knowledge_base` context (catalog/search/activity modules) with public API skeletons aligned to spec requirements and shared type definitions in `lib/dashboard_ssd/knowledge_base/types.ex`.
- [X] T005 [P] [Foundational] Extend `lib/dashboard_ssd/integrations/notion.ex` to support database query and block retrieval with exponential backoff/circuit breaker; cover behaviour with integration tests in `test/dashboard_ssd/integrations/notion_test.exs`.
- [X] T006 [P] [Foundational] Implement ETS-backed cache module `lib/dashboard_ssd/knowledge_base/cache.ex` plus supervision wiring in `lib/dashboard_ssd/application.ex`; verify behaviour with unit tests in `test/dashboard_ssd/knowledge_base/cache_test.exs`.
- [X] T007 [P] [Foundational] Add telemetry + structured logging for Notion calls in `lib/dashboard_ssd/knowledge_base/instrumentation.ex` and hook into Phoenix Telemetry publishers; confirm via instrumentation tests in `test/dashboard_ssd/knowledge_base/instrumentation_test.exs`.

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Browse Collections Quickly (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Landing view surfaces curated collections with freshness signals and recently opened documents.

**Independent Test**: Load `/kb` as an authorized teammate and confirm collections, counts, and recently opened list render with correct ordering and empty-state messaging when data is unavailable.

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [X] T008 [P] [US1] Implement `DashboardSSD.KnowledgeBase.Catalog.list_collections/1` to merge Notion metadata and cache snapshots, including count/freshness calculations; add unit coverage in `test/dashboard_ssd/knowledge_base/catalog_test.exs`.
- [X] T009 [P] [US1] Implement `DashboardSSD.KnowledgeBase.Activity` to persist `kb.viewed` audits and fetch recent documents (max five) with fallbacks; test via `test/dashboard_ssd/knowledge_base/activity_test.exs`.
- [X] T010 [US1] Update `lib/dashboard_ssd_web/live/kb_live/index.ex` to load collections + recent activity on mount and expose assigns for the landing panel; add LiveView tests in `test/dashboard_ssd_web/live/kb_live_test.exs`.
- [X] T011 [P] [US1] Create reusable UI components for collection cards and recent list within `lib/dashboard_ssd_web/components/kb_components.ex` (and template partials if needed); add component rendering tests in `test/dashboard_ssd_web/components/kb_components_test.exs`.
- [X] T012 [US1] Implement empty-state and error message rendering for missing collections/notion failures inside `lib/dashboard_ssd_web/live/kb_live/index.ex`; extend LiveView tests to cover these scenarios.

**Checkpoint**: User Story 1 functional and demo-ready (MVP)

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Drill Into a Collection (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Selecting a collection shows document list with metadata, consistent ordering, and resilient empty/error states.

**Independent Test**: From the landing view select any collection and confirm document list renders with title, excerpt, tags, owner, timestamps, plus empty/error responses.

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [X] T013 [P] [US2] Implement `DashboardSSD.KnowledgeBase.Catalog.list_documents/2` to hydrate document summaries (title, excerpt, tags, owner, timestamps, share link) and cache results; cover with unit tests in `test/dashboard_ssd/knowledge_base/catalog_test.exs`.
- [X] T014 [US2] Enhance `lib/dashboard_ssd_web/live/kb_live/index.ex` to handle collection selection, load documents, persist last-selected collection in socket/session, and manage loading states; expand LiveView tests accordingly.
- [X] T015 [P] [US2] Build document list row/table components in `lib/dashboard_ssd_web/components/kb_components.ex` including tag/owner badges; add component tests in `test/dashboard_ssd_web/components/kb_components_test.exs`.
- [X] T016 [US2] Add empty-state + error banner handling for collection view (including retry action) in `lib/dashboard_ssd_web/live/kb_live/index.ex` and verify via LiveView tests.

**Checkpoint**: User Stories 1 & 2 independently functional

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Find and Read the Right Document (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Provide global search across collections and an in-app document reader that renders supported Notion blocks with metadata and share link.

**Independent Test**: Enter a search term, observe grouped results by collection, open a document, and ensure all supported block types render correctly with metadata and retry-friendly error handling.

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [X] T017 [P] [US3] Implement `DashboardSSD.KnowledgeBase.Search.search/2` combining cached metadata filtering with Notion search fallback and collection grouping; add unit tests in `test/dashboard_ssd/knowledge_base/search_test.exs`.
- [X] T018 [US3] Extend `lib/dashboard_ssd_web/live/kb_live/index.ex` search event handling for real-time filtering, grouping labels, and persistence of last query; update LiveView tests.
- [X] T019 [P] [US3] Build document renderer components (`lib/dashboard_ssd_web/components/kb_components.ex`) supporting headings, paragraphs, callouts, images, code, tables, and unsupported notice; add component tests in `test/dashboard_ssd_web/components/kb_components_test.exs` with fixture blocks.
- [ ] T020 [US3] Add metadata panel + share-link copy affordance within `lib/dashboard_ssd_web/live/kb_live/index.ex` and ensure audits log view events via `DashboardSSD.KnowledgeBase.Activity`; extend LiveView tests.
- [X] T021 [US3] Implement error/retry flows for search, block fetch, and share-link issues with telemetry spans in `lib/dashboard_ssd_web/live/kb_live/index.ex`; verify via LiveView tests and instrumentation assertions.

**Checkpoint**: All user stories complete and independently testable

---

## Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Hardening, accessibility, documentation, and operational validation

- [ ] T022 [P] [Polish] Perform accessibility review (keyboard focus order, ARIA labels, contrast) for `/kb` and adjust components in `lib/dashboard_ssd_web/components/kb_components.ex` as needed.
- [ ] T023 [P] [Polish] Validate telemetry/log output by exercising Notion success/failure paths via `mix test` and review logs; tune configuration in `config/prod.exs` / `config/dev.exs`.
- [ ] T024 [P] [Polish] Update knowledge base guides in `docs/` and quickstart checklists to reflect new flows, including `specs/004-enhance-the-existing/quickstart.md` sync.
- [ ] T025 [Polish] Execute full quickstart validation (environment setup, `mix test`, `mix credo --strict`, `mix dialyzer`, and manual `/kb` smoke test) and record results in `specs/004-enhance-the-existing/quickstart.md` notes.

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies
- **Phase 1 ‚Üí Phase 2**: Setup tasks unblock foundational work.
- **Phase 2 ‚Üí Phases 3-5**: Foundational infrastructure must be complete before any user story implementation.
- **User Story Phases (3-5)**: Execute in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3) for MVP cadence; stories may proceed in parallel once dependent components are stable.
- **Phase 6**: Begins after desired user stories reach checkpoints.

### User Story Dependencies
- **US1** depends on Phase 2 completion; no other story dependencies.
- **US2** depends on Phase 2 and shared catalog primitives from US1.
- **US3** depends on Phase 2 plus catalog/search primitives established in US1/US2.

### Within-Story Sequencing
- Implement context/services before LiveView/UI changes.
- Update LiveView behaviour before adding polish/error handling that depends on new assigns.
- Tests accompany each task (ensure failing test first per constitution).

## Parallel Opportunities
- Setup tasks (T001‚ÄìT003) are independent and can run concurrently.
- Foundational tasks T005‚ÄìT007 touch separate modules and can progress in parallel once T004 scaffolding exists.
- Within US1, tasks T008, T009, and T011 target different files and may proceed concurrently after foundational readiness.
- US2 tasks T013 and T015 can run in parallel; US3 tasks T017 and T019 are similarly parallelizable.
- Phase 6 tasks T022‚ÄìT024 can run in parallel; T025 waits until earlier polish tasks complete.

## Parallel Example: User Story 3

```bash
# Context + search logic can progress alongside renderer work once Phase 2 completes.
Task: T017 [P] [US3] Implement KnowledgeBase.Search service
Task: T019 [P] [US3] Build document renderer components
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)
1. Complete Phases 1 & 2 to establish infrastructure.
2. Deliver Phase 3 tasks T008‚ÄìT012 for landing view improvements.
3. Validate `/kb` landing view via LiveView tests and manual check, then demo.

### Incremental Delivery
1. Finish Setup and Foundational phases.
2. Implement US1 (Phase 3) ‚Üí deploy as MVP.
3. Layer US2 (Phase 4) for collection browsing ‚Üí redeploy.
4. Layer US3 (Phase 5) for global search & reader ‚Üí redeploy.
5. Apply Phase 6 polish after core stories are live.

### Parallel Team Strategy
- After Phase 2, assign:
  - Developer A: Phase 3 (US1)
  - Developer B: Phase 4 (US2)
  - Developer C: Phase 5 (US3)
- Coordinate via shared fixtures and component libs; reconvene for Phase 6 polish before release.

## Notes
- Respect constitution gates: LiveView-first, no new tables, observability coverage.
- Keep tasks atomic; commit after each task or logical pair.
- Stop at each checkpoint to validate independent story completion.
- Treat telemetry/log verification as part of definition of done for external integrations.
