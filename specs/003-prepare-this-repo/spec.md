# Feature Specification: Prepare Repo for CD with ArgoCD

**Feature Branch**: `003-prepare-this-repo`  
**Created**: Fri Oct 10 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "prepare this repo for CD with argocd. we already have a gitops repo available"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Set Up Repository for ArgoCD Deployment (Priority: P1)

As a DevOps engineer, I want to prepare the repository with necessary configurations and manifests so that ArgoCD can automatically deploy the application from this repository.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality required to enable Continuous Deployment, providing automated and reliable deployments.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by verifying that ArgoCD successfully syncs and deploys the application from the prepared repository, delivering automated deployment capability.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the repository has been prepared with ArgoCD configurations, **When** a code change is pushed to the main branch, **Then** ArgoCD automatically detects the change and initiates deployment.
2. **Given** the repository is configured for ArgoCD, **When** ArgoCD syncs the application, **Then** the deployment completes successfully without manual intervention.
3. **Given** an existing GitOps repository, **When** the new repository is prepared, **Then** it integrates seamlessly with the GitOps workflow.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the GitOps repository is temporarily inaccessible during deployment?
- How does the system handle ArgoCD sync failures due to configuration errors?
- What occurs if multiple deployments are triggered simultaneously?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST include ArgoCD Application manifests that define how the application should be deployed.
- **FR-002**: System MUST have deployment configurations compatible with the existing GitOps repository structure.
- **FR-003**: System MUST support automated syncing when code changes are pushed to the repository.
- **FR-004**: System MUST integrate with the existing GitOps repository for centralized deployment management.
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide rollback capabilities through ArgoCD in case of deployment failures.
- **FR-006**: System MUST build and push Docker image to GHCR as part of CI process, only when all checks pass.

### Out of Scope

- Implementation of the GitOps repository itself.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **ArgoCD Application**: Represents the deployment configuration for the application, including source repository, target cluster, and sync policies.
- **Deployment Manifests**: Kubernetes manifests or Helm charts that define the application's infrastructure and services.
- **GitOps Repository**: The existing centralized repository that manages deployment configurations across multiple applications.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- Security: Use basic authentication only, with environment variables for secrets.
- Scalability: Support up to 5 concurrent deployments.
- Observability: Built-in metrics and application logs.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 100% of code pushes to the main branch result in successful automated deployments via ArgoCD.
- **SC-002**: Deployment time from code push to running application is under 5 minutes.
- **SC-003**: ArgoCD sync success rate is above 95% over a 30-day period.
- **SC-004**: Rollback operations complete successfully in under 2 minutes when initiated.

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-10

- Q: What security and privacy measures should be implemented for the ArgoCD deployment process? → A: Use basic authentication only, with environment variables for secrets.
- Q: What are the scalability assumptions for concurrent deployments? → A: Support up to 5 concurrent deployments.
- Q: What features are explicitly out of scope for this preparation? → A: GitOps repo implementation.
- Q: What observability requirements are needed (logging, metrics, tracing)? → A: Built-in metrics and application logs.
