# Tasks: Prepare Repo for CD

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/003-prepare-this-repo/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: The feature specification does not request testing or TDD approach. Tests are optional and not included.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [X] T001 Create .github/workflows/ directory for CI pipelines
- [X] T002 Create Dockerfile for containerized application build

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [X] T003 Configure GitHub repository settings for packages and container registry access
- [X] T004 Set up GitHub Actions permissions for package publishing

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Set Up Repository for Continuous Deployment (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Prepare the repository with necessary configurations and manifests for continuous deployment.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by verifying that the deployment pipeline successfully builds and deploys the application, delivering automated deployment capability.

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [X] T005 [US1] Create GitHub Actions workflow file .github/workflows/ci.yml with Docker build and push to GHCR
- [X] T006 [US1] Update application configuration to read from environment variables in config/runtime.exs

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently

---

## Phase N: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories

- [X] T007 [P] Update README.md with deployment instructions
- [X] T008 [P] Add deployment documentation to docs/
- [X] T009 Test Docker build locally before committing

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories

### Within Each User Story

- Models before services
- Services before endpoints
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All implementation tasks for User Story 1 marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all parallel tasks for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create GitHub Actions workflow file .github/workflows/ci.yml with Docker build and push to GHCR"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
